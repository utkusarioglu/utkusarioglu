Near and medium future will be filled with distruptions that will go above and beyond what we have seen so far. The "human" of the gaps is already struggling with redefinig itself in the age of weak AI, and special-purpose machinery. The way I see it, many of the imminent advancements ahead of us will only exacerbate these struggles.

I have been focusing my efforts on building social and financial systems for the improvement of trust, and economic liberation and mobility in societies. For these, I employ
decentralized, traditional and hybrid systems. 

I'm an economist by degree and I have been professionally coding for more than 5 years. I have also worked as an international trader in the food industry and lead multi million-dollar engineering and trade projects.
