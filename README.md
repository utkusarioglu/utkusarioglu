### Hello

I believe that beauty comes from wholenes; it's an allure that streams from the solution that the code serves, to the process, the design, down till every line of concise but readable code. Written with dedication to the whole; not the code itself. Because of this, I strive to understand at least a little bit about every part of the system, and I try to improve my understanding of our precious craft through time and projects' needs.
