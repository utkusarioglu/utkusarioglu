### Hey 

My name is Utku. I have been coding on and off since I was 15. A few years back, I decided to fully commit to coding and I haven't looked back since. 

I believe that beauty comes from wholenes; it's an allure that streams from the solution that the code serves, to the process, the design, down till every line of concise but readable code. Written with dedication to the whole, not the code itself.

Because of this, I strive to understand at least a little bit about every part of the system, and try to improve on my understanding through time and project needs.
